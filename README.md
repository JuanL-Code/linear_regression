# Linear Regression Algorithm

In this repository there is a file with a brief explanation about linear regression and a Python implementation for a pair of datasets, finally as part of the implementation a graphical demonstration of the results and how they agree with those obtained in the physical resolution. They were used for the numpy implementation to find certain statistical metrics by means of functions and matplot for later graphing.
